# CD-List-Classical-By-Subgenre
Badtoven. Very bad. 

Music is *always* dramatic: just ask Bach. What's a G chord, Bach. "GBD." What's a G 21 add flat elephant. "Fuck you. That's jazz." I knew that there was something wrong with jazz. *Ah*, I knew it.... Out-bumming Bach: That's a bad sign. Ah. Ah, mercy. *Ah, mercy.* Bad-aides don't fix bullet holes, you say sorry just for show.... Ah. Juno's mercy. 

What: I notice that there are, like, sixty of them, but they all--

Ah, music. I could explain it you or whatever, but it'd take awhile, and your not pay attention....

I cried once for you, Rose. I shall not cry a second time. 

But yeah, subgenres: I'm gonna write Tuesday music. Tuesday afternoon is never ending: therefore, you must write symphonies on Tuesdays. You must. *You must!*

~ Dance forms 

Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry, but you exist for other people. Sorry about that. Fuck you, though.

^ Ballet 

A cosmopolitan-in-the-sense-of-European form of dance, which is narrative, and which does not employ verbal language. Go see it. It's underestimated by assholes, and villainized by the cowardly. 

-- Tchaikovsky [Died c. 1900]

(Victorian janitor man) You must sweep the floor the right way. It must be correct. There is a, right analysis. 

Tchaikovsky is the best: that is the correct analysis, and this is the principal, though not the only reason. Tchaikovsky is to jazz, I mean.... What are the Beatles are to the real world. 

I am giving you the correct answer, to the question. Thank you, thank you. I hate you too, I do. I really do. I hate you like a brother, who mistreats our sister. 

^ Folk Dance. 

Peasants in dunlap leather. A bit of polish. 

"Rose started her ballet training when she was four." 

Fuck. I'm older than four. 

*I should have planned ahead!*

-- J Strauss [Died c. 1900]

"With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them;and they were ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them."

Did you know that Johann Strauss II was related to Mr Gardiner on his mother's side, and to Jane Austen on his father's side? Course you didn't. Cause it isn't true, now, is it. Ah. But it is. *But it is!* 

He set people up. 

~ Orchestral forms 

(Technically stage works employ an orchestra, but that's a rather technical point.) 

Anyway, yeah, I mean, it can be good, it can be.... *oh, did he just stab me right in my gut: the bastard!* 

I believe that the fashionable term is "white people problems". 

Symphonies are down 11%, concertos are down 7%, anthracite coal is down 9%. A very bad year for white people, 1847. 

Yeah, they don't like it when you play hardball, the white people. Like little girls who destroy Africa with fire-bombs, the white people. 

Badtoven. Very bad, Badtoven....

Like, I don't know: Ryan Tedder. He's a clever guy, Ryan Tedder: he put together his own rock band, Ryan Tedder. It sucks. Whose fault is that. He's a good songwriter, he could live anywhere he wants to just on that. Is somebody gonna do, like, Against Tedder Day-- no, ah, no. You know what I mean, like, nobody's gonna come after him: it's his life. He's a talented songwriter and he writes songs that suck, and that's on him. He wastes his talent because he doesn't get out of his own way. Like, one day, Ryan Tedder isn't going to be an astronomer writing about geology or whatever: when Europe colonizes the moon, he'll go ahead and figure himself out.... A lot of whites are like Ryan Tedder, or considerably worse. So try a little responsibility. Flop symphonies in the 1840s, who's the villain? Fox news! Rebels in Swaziland! Yeah, *sarcastic*, good for you. 

Good thing ballerinas don't have bills, the way that conductors do, for: I'm sorry. For giving interviews, and going on the CD jewel case. 

^ Symphonies 

A symphony is a work that uses the entire orchestra. It's evenly mixed, with no soloist. 

The rather crude by heavy hammer I like to deploy against the symphony from time to time, is that there might be more people in the orchestra than the audience. It risks becoming an artist's art, and nothing else, which ultimately means white people trying to get themselves paid for amusing themselves only, at the expense of such "rich" people as end up being Doug Heffernan, tax payer. And, *obviously*, if they play serialist music, they are simply and blatantly pirates, and probably psychically hurting themselves, as well. 

But yeah, I mean: *every* instrument. Incidentally, also violins: they need like, dozens or whatever, duplicating the exact same thing for volume purposes only. I mean, I know there was a time: but what about Roger the Engineer? I don't know the technical details, but I'm guessing that something like technology which smacks of freedom might be frowned on. A jazz orchestra is the euphemism for an orchestra without the crap, or at least, one possible such arrangement. You can experiment with writing postmodern bug music, but please, don't experiment with anyone's paycheck. We're white people. We have privileges. We have institutions. 

I guess you have to ask yourself at what point does institutionalization enter symphony writing. 

I mean, an orchestra is basically the result, it seems to me, of anthropologists scouring the continent of Europe for musical instruments, and carting the contents of their search back to Germany for analysis. (Germany was invented by white people.) There seems to be relatively little: Eh, tell the brass to go home early. Or. Eh, tell the strings to go home early. You know. You were always supposed to be a lot like the others-- they just like, patterns, practically all of them. They sorta liked to get it set.... Of course the modern response is to write operas about the IRA. That's white people compromise: Downfall parody. (Imagine if Stalin lost his shit like that: he'd revert to Georgian, and nobody'd, you know: that would be the end of that, basically. They'd all be too scared for anything to work: scared deep in their bones, where it hurts.... But white people: Eh. I'm done now. It's just 'cause I didn't get what I wanted. That's all.)

But, yeah, every *possible* instrument: that's art, white people style. I mean, I went in, I, well, I had no instructions, really, from any *"mala gente"*, right.... So.... Well, I should do something versatile, right. Piano. Done. Done and dusted. Of course, I automatically chose the more "intellectual" side of reality: automatic. But some of these orchestra instruments-- I mean, if you looked at the whole music industry and you wanted to do some weird estimate of the industry participation of different instruments, the corners of the orchestra, the dusty corners of the orchestra.... Eh, it's mostly empty corners. Like in "The Soloist", where Badtoven's Uncle Tom is required to shame white people into going back to work in the castle: "Nobody likes Uncle Tom's Tin Cap Flute", you know.... You know, if white people are too bored or ashamed of castle life, then maybe we don't need our wise masters from the New York Times to brainwash some black stooges into submission. (That's right, Wynton Marsalis: you are a slave. You are a slave, and you are a snob....) I mean, the bottom line is I look at some of these instruments, and I ask myself where they get sheet music, even, or where they think they're going to go or what they think they're going to do, or why people just assume that people are always going to be on beck and call to our wise masters from NPR, always ready to play the Tin Hat Flute at a moment's notice. (Stand up, break free.) I mean: are these people paid, tricked or proud, you know. What's the deal. What's the deal, America....

I know, considering that if you look at it from the POV of symphony writers and not the symphony machine it often seems more positive, Yeah.... But, I mean.... Who has the guts to tame a machine: you know conductors are just getting paid, I mean like: this is what the brass is gonna give me, not-- oh, yeah, trumpet work, sure.... And I think, just generally, you talk *so* over subtle to absurd skiddish people, that in the end, a common problem is to end up talking about things that aren't *really* there: when you get bad, that's the point....

I know, right. I'm a raider out of the North, out of Sweden....

^ Concertos

~ Small Instrumentation 

You know how little kids always get taught about "The Four Seasons" and "The Surprise Symphony"? Yes. I hate small children as well. Reciprocity, ha. *waves hands* 

^ Chamber Music 

Rock music comes from the devil. David Gates comes from the devil. 

^ Solo Piano 

On the one hand, sure, we have Robert Schumann saying, I could bang out a couple of these solo piano bits in the time it would take to write a bad symphony. But give the devil a piano, and he'll make you a snob. 

Hermes: *looking up at a large poster of James Taylor in his youth with an acoustic guitar* That's so cool. 

*giggles* 

-- JS Bach [Died c. 1750]

Prepare for to slaughter the sacred wig.... *forty children swarm over him, like video game antagonists* 

I mean, part of it is the shitty village, I'll allow that.... We can build a piano with one octave: this that good enough. 

But Bach, you know. *School.* The intellectual's intellectual. The white man's white man. 

*absurd French accent* Merely walk over to piano and begin pressing as many keys as possible. This is the music! When this is mastered, begin eating Ã©clairs at the same time: because this is possible, for France! (Yes, so German, yet so French.)

I mean, at the end of the day, it's marks on paper. I don't want to buy into the whole Revolutionary Pianist Makes Bach Wear Slacks crap, or do the entire explanation of that, but.... Why not fetishize the marks on the page, if it's the only thing that Daddy literally gave you? Wow, that even looks hard. You know, like a piano teacher. Cool: something hard. *Like, dude, I disagree with your analysis*. Only marks. On a page. Consider how very recent in the classical timescale even the most absurdly old things are.

Robert Johnson: Are you sure that the machine can suck up the sound out of the air. I feel like it might not work right. 

Somebody get that guy out of my studio. 

Chopin [Died c. 1850]

Yeah, I mean Chopin liked to take things from near the top of my list and slide them, all the way down to the bottom.

Is there something that that was supposed to accomplish. 

Yeah, it was the next one on the list. I stayed in the right key and everything. 

*Juno's mercy.*
