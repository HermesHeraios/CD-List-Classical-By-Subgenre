# CD-List-Classical-By-Subgenre
Badtoven. Very bad. 

Music is *always* dramatic: just ask Bach. What's a G chord, Bach. "GBD." What's a G 21 add flat elephant. "Fuck you. That's jazz." I knew that there was something wrong with jazz. *Ah*, I knew it.... Out-bumming Bach: That's a bad sign. Ah. Ah, mercy. *Ah, mercy.* Bad-aides don't fix bullet holes, you say sorry just for show.... Ah. Juno's mercy. 

What: I notice that there are, like, sixty of them, but they all--

Ah, music. I could explain it you or whatever, but it'd take awhile, and your not pay attention....

I cried once for you, Rose. I shall not cry a second time. 

But yeah, subgenres: I'm gonna write Tuesday music. Tuesday afternoon is never ending: therefore, you must write symphonies on Tuesdays. You must. *You must!*

~ Dance forms 

Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry, but you exist for other people. Sorry about that. Fuck you, though.

^ Ballet 

A cosmopolitan-in-the-sense-of-European form of dance, which is narrative, and which does not employ verbal language. Go see it. It's underestimated by assholes, and villainized by the cowardly. 

* Tchaikovsky [Died c. 1900]

(Victorian janitor man) You must sweep the floor the right way. It must be correct. There is a, right analysis. 

Tchaikovsky is the best: that is the correct analysis, and this is the principal, though not the only reason. Tchaikovsky is to jazz, I mean.... What are the Beatles are to the real world. 

I am giving you the correct answer, to the question. Thank you, thank you. I hate you too, I do. I really do. I hate you like a brother, who mistreats our sister. 

^ Folk Dance. 

Peasants in dunlap leather. A bit of polish. 

"Rose started her ballet training when she was four." 

Fuck. I'm older than four. 

*I should have planned ahead!*

* J Strauss [Died c. 1900]

"With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them;,and they were ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them."

Did you know that Johann Strauss II was related to Mr Gardiner on his mother's side, and to Jane Austen on his father's side? Course you didn't. Cause it isn't true, now, is it. Ah. But it is. *But it is!* 

He set people up.
