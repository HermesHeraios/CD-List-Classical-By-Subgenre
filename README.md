# CD-List-Classical-By-Subgenre
Badtoven. Very bad. 

Music is *always* dramatic: just ask Bach. What's a G chord, Bach. "GBD." What's a G 21 add flat elephant. "Fuck you. That's jazz." I knew that there was something wrong with jazz. *Ah*, I knew it.... Out-bumming Bach: That's a bad sign. Ah. Ah, mercy. *Ah, mercy.* Bad-aides don't fix bullet holes, you say sorry just for show.... Ah. Juno's mercy. 

What: I notice that there are, like, sixty of them, but they all--

Ah, music. I could explain it you or whatever, but it'd take awhile, and your not pay attention....

I cried once for you, Rose. I shall not cry a second time. 

But yeah, subgenres: I'm gonna write Tuesday music. Tuesday afternoon is never ending: therefore, you must write symphonies on Tuesdays. You must. *You must!*

~ Dance forms 

Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry, but you exist for other people. Sorry about that. Fuck you, though.

^ Ballet 

A cosmopolitan-in-the-sense-of-European form of dance, which is narrative, and which does not employ verbal language. Go see it. It's underestimated by assholes, and villainized by the cowardly. 

-- Tchaikovsky [Died c. 1900]

(Victorian janitor man) You must sweep the floor the right way. It must be correct. There is a, right analysis. 

Tchaikovsky is the best: that is the correct analysis, and this is the principal, though not the only reason. Tchaikovsky is to jazz, I mean.... What are the Beatles are to the real world. 

I am giving you the correct answer, to the question. Thank you, thank you. I hate you too, I do. I really do. I hate you like a brother, who mistreats our sister. 

^ Folk Dance. 

Peasants in dunlap leather. A bit of polish. 

"Rose started her ballet training when she was four." 

Fuck. I'm older than four. 

*I should have planned ahead!*

-- J Strauss [Died c. 1900]

"With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them;and they were ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them."

Did you know that Johann Strauss II was related to Mr Gardiner on his mother's side, and to Jane Austen on his father's side? Course you didn't. Cause it isn't true, now, is it. Ah. But it is. *But it is!* 

He set people up. 

~ Orchestral forms 

(Technically stage works employ an orchestra, but that's a rather technical point.) 

Anyway, yeah, I mean, it can be good, it can be.... *oh, did he just stab me right in my gut: the bastard!* 

I believe that the fashionable term is "white people problems". 

Symphonies are down 11%, concertos are down 7%, anthracite coal is down 9%. A very bad year for white people, 1847. 

Yeah, they don't like it when you play hardball, the white people. Like little girls who destroy Africa with fire-bombs, the white people. 

Badtoven. Very bad, Badtoven....

Like, I don't know: Ryan Tedder. He's a clever guy, Ryan Tedder: he put together his own rock band, Ryan Tedder. It sucks. Whose fault is that. He's a good songwriter, he could live anywhere he wants to just on that. Is somebody gonna do, like, Against Tedder Day-- no, ah, no. You know what I mean, like, nobody's gonna come after him: it's his life. He's a talented songwriter and he writes songs that suck, and that's on him. He wastes his talent because he doesn't get out of his own way. Like, one day, Ryan Tedder isn't going to be an astronomer writing about geology or whatever: when Europe colonizes the moon, he'll go ahead and figure himself out.... A lot of whites are like Ryan Tedder, or considerably worse. So try a little responsibility. Flop symphonies in the 1840s, who's the villain? Fox news! Rebels in Swaziland! Yeah, *sarcastic*, good for you. 

Good thing ballerinas don't have bills, the way that conductors do, for: I'm sorry. For giving interviews, and going on the CD jewel case. 

^ Symphonies 

^ Concertos

~ Small Instrumentation 

You know how little kids always get taught about "The Four Seasons" and "The Surprise Symphony"? Yes. I hate small children as well. Reciprocity, ha. *waves hands* 

^ Chamber Music 

Rock music comes from the devil. David Gates comes from the devil. 

^ Solo Piano 

On the one hand, sure, we have Robert Schumann saying, I could bang out a couple of these solo piano bits in the time it would take to write a bad symphony. But give the devil a piano, and he'll make you a snob. 

Hermes: *looking up at a large poster of James Taylor in his youth with an acoustic guitar* That's so cool. 

*giggles* 

-- JS Bach [Died c. 1750]

Prepare for to slaughter the sacred wig.... *forty children swarm over him, like video game antagonists* 

I mean, part of it is the shitty village, I'll allow that.... We can build a piano with one octave: this that good enough. 

But Bach, you know. *School.* The intellectual's intellectual. The white man's white man. 

*absurd French accent* Merely walk over to piano and begin pressing as many keys as possible. This is the music! When this is mastered, begin eating Ã©clairs at the same time: because this is possible, for France! (Yes, so German, yet so French.)

I mean, at the end of the day, it's marks on paper. I don't want to buy into the whole Revolutionary Pianist Makes Bach Wear Slacks crap, or do the entire explanation of that, but.... Why not fetishize the marks on the page, if it's the only thing that Daddy literally gave you? Wow, that even looks hard. You know, like a piano teacher. Cool: something hard. *Like, dude, I disagree with your analysis*. Only marks. On a page. Consider how very recent in the classical timescale even the most absurdly old things are.

Robert Johnson: Are you sure that the machine can suck up the sound out of the air. I feel like it might not work right. 

Somebody get that guy out of my studio. 

Chopin [Died c. 1850]

Yeah, I mean Chopin liked to take things from near the top of my list and slide them, all the way down to the bottom.

Is there something that that was supposed to accomplish. 

Yeah, it was the next one on the list. I stayed in the right key and everything. 

*Juno's mercy.*
