Badtoven. Very bad. 

Music is *always* dramatic: just ask Bach. What's a G chord, Bach. "GBD." What's a G 21 add flat elephant. "Fuck you. That's jazz." I knew that there was something wrong with jazz. *Ah*, I knew it.... Out-bumming Bach: That's a bad sign. Ah. Ah, mercy. *Ah, mercy.* Bad-aides don't fix bullet holes, you say sorry just for show.... Ah. Juno's mercy. 

What: I notice that there are, like, sixty of them, but they all--
Ah, music. I could explain it you or whatever, but it'd take awhile, and your not pay attention....

I cried once for you, Rose. I shall not cry a second time. 

But yeah, subgenres: I'm gonna write Tuesday music. Tuesday afternoon is never ending: therefore, you must write symphonies on Tuesdays. You must. *You must!*

Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry, but you exist for other people. Sorry about that. Fuck you, though.
